Now is the winter of our discontent
Made glorious summer by this sun of York
And all the clouds that lourd upon our house
In the deep bosom of the ocean buried
Now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths
Our bruised arms hung up for monuments
Our stern alarums changed to merry meetings
Our dreadful marches to delightful measures
Grim visaged war hath smoothd his wrinkled front
And now instead of mounting barded steeds
To fright the souls of fearful ad versaries
He capers nimbly in a ladys chamber
To the lascivious pleasing of a lute
But I that am not shaped for sportive tricks
Nor made to court an amorous looking glass
I that am rudely stampd and want loves majesty
To strut before a wanton ambling nymph
I that am curtaild of this fair proportion
Cheated of feature by dis sembling nature
Deformed unfinishd sent before my time
Into this breathing world scarce half made up
And that so lamely and un fashion able
That dogs bark at me as I halt by them
Why I in this weak piping time of peace
Have no delight to pass away the time
Unless to spy my shadow in the sun
And descant on mine own deformity
And therefore since I cannot prove a lover
To entertain these fair wellspoken days
I am determined to prove a villain
And hate the idle pleasures of these days
Plots have I laid inductions dangerous
By drunken prophecies libels and dreams
To set my brother Clarence and the king
In deadly hate the one against the other
And if King Edward be as true and just
As I am subtle false and treach erous
This day should Clarence closely be mewd up
About a prophecy which says that G
Of Edwards heirs the murderer shall be
Dive thoughts down to my soul here
Clarence comes
.
